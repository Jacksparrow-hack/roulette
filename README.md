# ☠️ Roulette Prediction System — Hacked Logic ☠️

> **⚠️ WARNING: This is not a game. This is a weaponized roulette analyzer. Use with extreme caution.**

This project is a high-risk prediction engine designed to simulate, track, and predict roulette outcomes based on past winning numbers. The algorithm mimics behavior found in real-world European roulette systems using pattern-based hacks, terminal number networks, and predictive plays.

## 💣 What Is This?

An interface that looks simple, but operates like a reverse-engineered prediction machine. It accepts recent roulette results and calculates the most likely outcomes based on:

- Pattern reversal
- Terminal proximity
- Directional mapping
- Spin confirmation systems

Behind its basic design lies a logic tree optimized to track and beat typical roulette randomness.

## ⚙️ Files Included

- `index.html` – The clean, responsive interface. Hidden power beneath simplicity.
- `admin.js` – Where the prediction logic, number traps, and terminal handlers live. This file is the engine.

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ Real-time predictions based on number input  
- ✅ 7 different calculation paths with spin confirmations  
- ✅ Terminal-based strategy mapping  
- ✅ Neighbor bets and number proximity logic  
- ✅ Distance tracking and confirmations  
- ⚠️ Looks harmless. Works like black magic.
